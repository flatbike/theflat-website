**New Hours** **_The SSMU building now closes at 8pm, so the Flat will be closing at 7.30_**. Our goal is to continue to be open Monday, Tuesday and Thursday, however, our schedule is dependent on volunteers. We will post any closures here. Unfortunately, **_the building will be closing at 6pm during July and August_** , so the Flat will not be able to operate our regular evening shifts. We will be trying out day shifts (2-6pm) in July. **Volunteer!** Know a little about bikes? Know a lot? Don't know a thing? We need volunteers of all sorts, so consider volunteering! You can [Email us!](<mailto:theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com>) If you are hesitant, come visit us at the shop and introduce yourself. **Wednesdays at the Flat** Wednesdays we host a variety of events at the Flat. **Collective Meeting: 6 June, 2012** The first Wednesday of the month is our **Collective Meeting**. Everyone is welcome to participate. Meetings start at 5.30 at the Flat. **Women, Trans, and Queer Night: 13 June, 2012** The second Wednesday of the month is our WTQ Night. We are open for women, trans and queer folk to work on their bikes. We are also looking for volunteers to help out! **Tasquerade: 20 June, 2012** The third Wednesday of the month is our Tasquerade. We spend a few hours tidying the shop, organising donations, general maintenance of the space as well as great music and pizza. Never volunteered with the Flat? It is a great way to get to know both the space and the other volunteers. **Workshops: 27 June, 2012** The fourth Wednesday of the month we reserve for workshops. The workshop is still TBA for June--stayposted! **In the works** We are in the process of scheduling regular bike builds. We are also in the process of scheduling a wheelbuilding class. Interested in either? Email us. **Volunteers** Did we forget to mention we needed volunteers? We need volunteers! Come on out!
