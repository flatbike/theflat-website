From September 24th - 26th there will be a bike co-op conference held here in Montreal located at UQAM. It will be a great opportunity to get to know the greater bike co-op community (there will be people from all 7 of montreal's bike co-ops as well as other community bike organizations), attend interesting workshops (ie: smashing bikes back to life, how to run a bike shop, anti-oppression, working with immigrants, 3-speed hubs, winter biking, summary of united bicycle institute lessons on modern bike repair, etc ...), and have some fun (musical bike performance, food served, party saturday night, and more ...). All volunteers and bikey folks are encouraged to attend.
