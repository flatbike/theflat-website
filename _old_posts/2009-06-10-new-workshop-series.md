Meeting WEDNESDAY JUNE 10 AT 6PM, in the lounge of the Shatner Building on McGill campus (one floor above the shop) for anyone interested in lending a hand, coordinating or teaching in the next workshop series. Without community involvement these workshops are not possible, so come on out. Wanted: Workshop Coordinators Do you have a certain level of expertise on all or some bike components that you'd like share? We need people interested in leading workshops for the summer months. If you've ever attended a workshop at the Flat, you'll know they are always informative as well as friendly and informal. Or, for example, do you know enough about bottom brackets to teach other people if you had a sidekick to back you up? We can arrange for you to teach with someone else too. Please send an e-mail to _theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com_ if you're interested.
