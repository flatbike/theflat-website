Summer semester is here, which means a lot of our volunteers are not in town. Whether it's RAships, field schools, work, or vacation, people are not around as regularly as in the fall and winter terms. As an entirely volunteer-run organisation, this is inevitable. It also means that often, we won't be able to open 3 days a week. Please check our [facebook page](<https://www.facebook.com/TheFlatBikeCollective/>) (you don't need fb to [see our page](<https://www.facebook.com/TheFlatBikeCollective/>)!) for our most up-to-date schedule. We'll try to post the weekend before each new week with what days we'll be operational. Thanks for your understanding!
