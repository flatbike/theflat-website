Are you thinking about riding your bike through the winter but don't really know if it's feasible? Are you looking for advice on how to winterize your ride and yourself? If your answer is "yes," you should come to our workshop/info session at The Flat on **Wednesday, October 24 at 7pm**. Krzysztof and Harald will share their experiences with riding year-round, offer advice, and answer your questions. As always, the workshop is free and open to anyone. Please RSVP to [theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com](<mailto:theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com>)
