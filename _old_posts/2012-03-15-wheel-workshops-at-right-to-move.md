Our friends from [Right to Move/La Voie Libre](<http://www.rtm-lvl.org/>) at Concordia will host two workshops about wheels on March 25 and April 1. The workshops will be held at Right to Move. Please RVSP to [righttomove@gmail.com](<mailto:righttomove@gmail.com>)

> We will be holding a truing workshop on Sunday, the 25th of March, and a wheel-building workshop on Sunday, the 1st of April. Both workshops will commence at 11:00AM, and go until approximately 1:30PM. The cost for each workshop will be $5.00. Those coming to either workshop, and especially the wheel-building workshop are suggested to have at least a base knowledge of wheels and wheel-truing. As well, those wishing to attend the wheel-building workshop are strongly encouraged to attend the truing workshop to ensure that everybody's on the same page. Due to limited resources, the number of people who can attend either workshop will be capped at 12. As such, anyone interested in attending either should rsvp as early as possible. Looking forward to seeing you there. -\- Right to Move/La voie libre <http://www.rtm-lvl.org/> Schedule: <http://www.rtm-lvl.org/phpicalendar/week.php> Tel: [514-999-4885](<514-999-4885>) mail: c/o QPIRG-Concordia 1500 de Maisonneuve o., Suite 204, Montréal, QC, Canada H3G 1N1
