Well, technically, Tuesdays never left.... But in our [meeting today](<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWVQb4GGUCj4cICpHo5yoKUjOW9Yo87oFPBzklngk1M/edit?usp=sharing>) we decided to not call Tuesday bike building days and return it to be *normal* open days. (Starting Tuesday May 24th, you can come in on Tuesdays with your bikes!) We are also experimenting with a different Tuesday opening hour: 4.00pm to 6.00 pm to be more accessible to different schedules! (Will change (or not?) based on reaction) Thanks for reading our website!
