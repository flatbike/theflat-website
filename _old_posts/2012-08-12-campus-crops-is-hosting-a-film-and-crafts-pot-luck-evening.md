FYI: **Campus Crops** is hosting an **free** evening of craft and film-watching fun times, **Sunday August 19th @ 7:30pm**! To start off, we'll be making some artsy **plant signs** (all materials will be provided). You can help us make some for our garden or make some for your own plants at home! Afterwards, we're going to be screening **The Global Banquet: Politics of Food** in our garden. The documentary "explores the politics that threaten global food security, and demonstrates the destructive aspects of the corporate globalization of food" (click [here](<http://resources.circle-m.ca/resourcecentre/ResourceView/18/287>) for more info on the film). Also, we'll have some **home-made vegan pizza** for you to snack on, made with some of our garden-fresh veg! (Potluck items would also be greatly appreciated!) **Everyone is welcome!** Feel free to drop by whenever - for one or both activities! When: Sunday, August 19th Sign-Making @ 7:30pm Film Screening @ 9pm (film is approx. 50mins.) Where:Garden behind 3534 University St. (*back-up rain location TBA*) 

Cost: **FREE!** Potluck items appreciated!

Hope to see you there!
