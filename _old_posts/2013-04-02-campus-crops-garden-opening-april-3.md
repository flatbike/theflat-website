Our friends from Campus Crops asked us to inform you that they're having their official garden opening this week:

> "Campus Crops' student-run garden is opening for the season on April 3rd*. Anyone interested in getting involved is invited to come to any (or all!) of the four weekly gardening sessions happening throughout April: Monday, Wednesday and Friday 5-7, and Saturday 1-5. The garden is located behind the McGill School of Environment @ 3534 University St. If you want to learn more, there are also weekly meetings held on Tuesday @ 5:30 in Burnside 305. Hope to see you there!
