UPDATE: we got an extension to our lease that's good for the next 6 months. However, if you know of anywhere near McGill that could be a potential place for us, please let us know... See you in the basement of 2075 Robert-Bourassa for now! \---Original post--- Hi everyone, our time at 2075 Robert-Bourassa is coming to an end on March 30. We are somewhat frantically looking for a new space to house us, but so far anything that appeared promising has fallen through. If we can't find a space, we'll have to go on hiatus, which would be super not ideal since it is just about to be bike season! If anyone has any leads for available spaces near McGill (since we are a McGill Service, technically), [**please let us know**](<mailto:theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com>)!! THANK YOU
