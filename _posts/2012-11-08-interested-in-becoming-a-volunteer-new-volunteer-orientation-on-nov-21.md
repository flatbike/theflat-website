[![Flyer volunteer orientation](http://theflat.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flyer_volunteer_workshop.png)](<http://theflat.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/flyer_volunteer_workshop.png>) Are you interested in volunteering at the Flat? Or you already are a volunteer but haven't done the mandatory orientation workshop yet? Then you should come to this month's volunteer orientation at the Flat on **Wednesday, November 21 from 4 to 5 pm**. Luz and Harald will tell you all you ever wanted to know about the inner workings of your favorite community bike shop and why volunteering there is great fun. After the workshop you can also hang around for our "taskerade", i.e. the monthly clean-up-and-eat-pizza gathering which will give you a chance to meet more volunteers. [RSVPing](<mailto:theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com?subject=November_Orientation>) is encouraged but you can also just drop in.
