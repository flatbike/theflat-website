Hi dear members of the FLAT community, I hope y'all had a wonderful winter break! Now that we are all back, I have bad news: based on the latest info from SSMU (Jan 4,) University Center will be closed for the month of January. I know this would be difficult for those of us who bike through winter (like myself,) bear with us as we wait for more updates from SSMU. In the meantime, stay warm, bike safe, follow health measures, and hopefully see you soon!
