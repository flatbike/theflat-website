We'd like to invite you all to the Flat Outing this Saturday. It's a get together, visioning session, and potluck all in one. There'll be some free food, but bring what you want to share. Similar with drinks. We plan to begin this at 6 in the evening but if you can't make it then, feel free to show up later. The address of the location is below. This is happening rain or shine. You do not need to have volunteered at the flat and bringing other bike enthusiast friends is welcome. All past, present, future, potential and also non- volunteers are welcome. It's gonna be fun. Venue: Coop sur Généreux, 4518 Avenue Papineau (NOT at the flat) April 13th. Saturday. 6 pm.
