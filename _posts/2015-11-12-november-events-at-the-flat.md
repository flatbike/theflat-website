Hey folks,

Besides our regular opening hours that allow you to fix your bike for free or teach others how to fix their bikes, the Flat is putting on some special events this month that may interest you:

**WT*Q Night**

**Wednesday Nov 11 - 5-7:30pm**

We open specially this Wednesday for female, trans*, and/or queer-identifying folk to fix their bikes with similarly-identified volunteers.

**Single Speed Conversion Workshop**

**Wednesday Nov 18 - 5:30-7:30pm**

Single speed/fixed gear are the best winter commuters because for their simplicity, time to learn how to build one from scratch! This workshop will mostly focus on how to convert an old road frame into a nice and handy single speed/fixed gear commuter. What pieces should you change? What parts can you keep and use until their end? We will also talk about the common problems encountered with a conversion, as well as some "security" basics concerning cops that you should know when riding a fixed gear.

Free workshop open to the public, including volunteers. Limited space - RSVP to theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com to attend.

**The Flat Bike Collective Visioning Meeting**

**Friday Nov 20 - 6-10pm**

25 Beaubien E

A biannual party-meeting of free dinner, communal drinking, deep discussion on the Flat's past, present, and future; followed by optional wild partying.

**Winterizing Workshop**

**Wednesday Dec 2 - 5-7:30pm** (not November, but really close!)

Bike mods, maintenance and general tips to keep you up and running this winter!

Free workshop open to the public, including volunteers. Limited space - RSVP to theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com to attend.

Cheers,

The Flat fam
