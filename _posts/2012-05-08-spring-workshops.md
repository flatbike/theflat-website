After a very long hiatus, the Flat is again offering **workshops**! **Note the schedule change** : Wednesday, 23 May: **5 - 6.30 How to Fix a Flat** **7 - 8:30 All You Ever Wanted to Know About Brakes (and then some)**

## How to fix a flat

Fixing a flat is the most common problem cyclists encounter, but it is not necessarily the most straight-forward! We'll start from the beginning and cover removing your wheel, patching, tube sizes, tire pressure, and plenty more. 

## All you ever wanted to know about brakes (and then some)

We will cover the various kinds of brakes, brake pads, and cables and housing. Everyone is welcome to attend, and there is no need to reserve a spot. Workshops are, as always, free to attend. We will announce future workshops as they are scheduled. Is there a workshop you would like to see offered? Email us at [theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com](<mailto:theflat.bikecollective@gmail.com>)
