We will probably re-open with either Monday Oct 11th or Monday Oct 18th 5.00pm - 7.30pm! We are using a same-day appointment system and you can [sign up here](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2JZhuAV-9GJL5cFfubXnKRG-tmubitaqvGnSk89vFs/edit?usp=sharing>). Proof of Vaccination will be required and unfortunately we can only have 2 users at a time at our SSMU basement space. For more information, you could visit [here](<https://theflat.wordpress.com/covid-special/>). We can't wait to see you! (follow our ins @theflatbikecollective !)
