A volunteer orientation day, for all those who have and/or would like to volunteer at the flat, will be held on March 18 at 7:30pm at the Flat. We strongly recommend that you attend if you are available during this time so that you can learn about what being a volunteer entails, express your interest in helping out, and meet the people you'll be working with. All persons welcome; no experience necessary. See you all on the big day.
