Soon enough (we hope) spring will be here. For us at the Flat that means that there will be tons of people wanting to get their bikes ready for the new season. If you're one of those people you might want to consider beating the spring rush and coming to the shop rather sooner than later. Recently it has been pretty quiet during shifts and our volunteers will be able to devote their almost undivided attention to all of your bike questions and problems. As always, the shop is open Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 5 to 7:30 pm. See you at the shop!
