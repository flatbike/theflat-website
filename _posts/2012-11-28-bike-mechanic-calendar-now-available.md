Your favorite bike mechanic calendar, the [Calendrier des Mécanos MTL](<http://calendrierdemecanos.wordpress.com/> "Calendrier des Mécanos MTL") (you can see some teaser pictures there), featuring volunteers from Montreal's community bike shops, is now available at the Flat during our regular hours. The calendar costs 15 dollars and all proceeds go towards the bike collective community in town. So come get your calendar(s), for yourself, your significant others, or your cool grandma!
