Despite the winter weather, the Flat continues to be open during our regular hours. However, the Shatner Building will be closed from December 21 to January 7. This means Thursday the 20th will be the last December shift at the Flat and we will back on Monday, January 7. Enjoy the winter break and keep riding safely!
