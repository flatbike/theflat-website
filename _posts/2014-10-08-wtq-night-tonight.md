We wish it weren't true, but there are environments where women, trans* or queer people don't feel welcome. Bike shops can be one of them! We open specially on the 2nd Wednesday of every month for a WT*Q night as an attempt to help address this. We welcome everyone identifying as female, trans*, and/or queer for a night of bike fixing and good jams, in a supportive + positive environment. Come wrench on bikes with like-minded people, leave with community and a smooth ride.
