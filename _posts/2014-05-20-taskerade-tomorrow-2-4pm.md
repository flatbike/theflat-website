Hey flatters/flat friends/flat enthusiasts!

Tomorrow is the third wednesday of May and you know what that means... TASKERADE!!! 

Come on out and help us organize and clean up the shop! There will be tasty treats, good tunes, and a whole lot of sorting + (re)arranging fun! 

If you're new to the space it's a great way to get to know the shop and meet and hang out with volunteers. If you're new to bikes, it's a great way to get to know the parts that make up a bike and the tools that go into fixing them. If you've been around a while and/or know a lot about bikes its a great way to help people who are newer to these things learn about them. 

Hope to see you there!
